# Develop!

This document is targeted at project developers. It helps people to make their
first steps. It also serves as a general entry to development documentation like
tooling configuration and usage.

The development environment should have the following tools:

- [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for project templating.
- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) for running self-documenting tasks.
- [Mdformat](https://github.com/hukkin/mdformat) for Markdown formatting.
- [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for managing pre-commit hooks.
- [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) for shell script linting.
- [Shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) for shell script formatting.
- [Uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for managing Python and friends.
- Unix-like. Not required by itself, but assumed as the standard.

Common tasks like initialization and runnings tests are covered by and
documented in [`Justfile`](./Justfile). To run a complete suite of tasks, just
invoke `just` without arguments.

This projects supports [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/). Check
out [`.devcontainer/README.md`](./.devcontainer/README.md) for more information.
